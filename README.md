# NFT Art Marketplace

This is NFT Marketplace project. I created this project using OpenZeppelin. It allows to owner to mint and burn NFTs. Also there are functions as to buy, sell and resell the NFTs. If the buyer of NFT decides to resell it, then comission goes to creator of NFT. Creator of NFT sets the comission amount. Also these NFTs with pictures can be seen in OpenSea as a collection.
